 <p><strong>Incident Details:</strong></p> 
 <p></p>
 <p>On Wednesday 13 November, 2013 Security &amp; Emergency Services were made aware of the following incident:</p> 
 <p>&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>At approximately 11:00 PM a female student was walking eastbound on the south side of Gould Street, crossing Church Street when she heard a vehicle honking at her. The student ignored the vehicle, although the vehicle followed her turning south on Dalhousie Street, which is a northbound one way Street. Subject 1, who was a passenger, yelled towards the student stating they “were looking for a girl” and asking for her phone number, her Facebook and offering to buy her a vehicle on her birthday. The student headed to her apartment and heard the vehicle’s door opening; the student hurried into the lobby. Subject 1 noticed people in the lobby, and quickly got back into the vehicle and drove off.</p> 
 <p>&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>Security &amp; Emergency Services checked the area for the vehicle which was described as an Orange Range Rover with a black top, but it was not located. The student was not physically injured in the incident. Toronto Police Services were notified of the incident.</p>
