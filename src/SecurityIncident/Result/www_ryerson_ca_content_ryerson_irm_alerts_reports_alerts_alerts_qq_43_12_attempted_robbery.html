 <p>On Monday 22 October, 2012 at approximately 10:00 pm, the following incident was reported to Ryerson University Security and Emergency Services:</p> 
 <p>&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>A female Ryerson student reported that at approximately 9:00 pm, while she was walking on the laneway between 40 Gerrard Street and 44 Gerrard Street building, she was approached by a male subject who was panhandling. After she told the subject she did not have any money, he demanded she check her purse and give him what she had. While she was checking her purse, the subject noticed a glass jar in the purse and said: "If you don't give me money, I'm going to smash that jar on your head", while clenching his hands. The subject then pointed towards a nearby convenience store and demanded she attend the store and withdraw money. The student went into the store and waited for the subject to leave the area.</p>
