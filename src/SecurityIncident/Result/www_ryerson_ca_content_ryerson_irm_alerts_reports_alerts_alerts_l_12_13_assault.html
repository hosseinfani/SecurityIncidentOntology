 <p><strong>Incident Details:</strong></p> 
 <p></p>
 <p>On Tuesday 23 July, 2013 Security and Emergency Services were made aware of the following incident:</p> 
 <p>&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>At approximately 6:35 pm a male student was walking along the hallway by TRS 1-149 (Ted Rogers School of Management), while the subject was walking in the opposite direction holding a Starbucks cup containing what was believed to be beer. The subject, who appeared intoxicated, bumped into the student and dropped his cup in the process. The student apologized and offered to buy the subject a bottle of water. The subject became aggressive towards the student and stated “You better pay me six dollars for that beer or, I'll punch you in your fucking face”. The student refused to pay and advised him to “back off”. The subject then pushed the student into a corner and stated “I have a Hells Angels tattoo, do you wanna fucking die? The student pushed the subject away from him. At the time a crowd had formed around the area, and the subject noticing this left heading towards the main elevator lobby. The area was searched by Security, but the man was not located.</p> 
 <p>&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>The victim had no physical injuries, and did not wish to file a report with Toronto Police Services.</p>
