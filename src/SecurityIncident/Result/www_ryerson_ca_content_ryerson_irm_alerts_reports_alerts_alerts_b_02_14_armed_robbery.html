 <p>On Wednesday 22 January, 2014 Security &amp; Emergency Services were made aware of the following incident:</p> 
 <p>&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>On Monday 20 January, 2014 at approximately 09:40 PM a male student was walking eastbound on the Northside of Gould Street just past 16 Gould Street. The student was then approached by the subjects who were behind him walking in the same direction. The subjects demanded the student’s phone, and an altercation resulted. During the altercation, subject 2 lifted his sweater and the student observed a brown metallic handle tucked in his waist. The student at this time handed the subjects his phone. Shortly after, the subjects determined the phone was not valuable and returned it to the victim. The subjects were last seen heading northbound on O’Keefe Laneway.&nbsp;</p>

 <p>The victim was not injured and did not wish to report the incident to Toronto Police Services.</p>
