 <p><strong>Incident Details:</strong></p> 
 <p></p>
 <p>On Sunday 13 October, 2013 Ryerson University Security and Emergency Services were made aware of the following incident:</p> 
 <p>&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>At approximately 09:29 PM a male student was sitting on the concrete planters by 50 Gould Street. The student was approached by the subjects who asked him if he had any “weed”. The student said no. One of the subjects then asked to use the student’s phone. The student said no. The subject then advised the student his friends were around the corner (pointed at the northeast corner of the Devonian Pond), and that the student could stay with them while the subject used the phone. The student agreed to this and began walking towards the Devonian Pond. On arrival at the northeast corner of the pond, the student noticed no one in the area. The subjects then attempted to pull a bag the student was carrying off him. Security and Emergency Services, who were nearby, began running towards them. The subjects quickly fled the area, with Subject 1 running north through the Quad and Subject 2 running south on Bond Street. The subjects, although unable to take the student’s bag, managed to take some cash and cigarettes.</p> 
 <p>&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>The student was not physically injured in the incident. Toronto Police Services attended the area and took over the investigation.</p>
