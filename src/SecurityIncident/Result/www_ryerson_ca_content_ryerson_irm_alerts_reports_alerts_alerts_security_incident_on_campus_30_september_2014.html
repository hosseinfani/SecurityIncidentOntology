 <p>&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>At approximately 03:20 PM a female student reported the subject approaching random female community members and repeatedly trying to hold their hands while attempting to engage them in conversation.</p> 
 <p>&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>Ryerson University Security &amp; Emergency Services promptly attended and located the subject in the area with another female student.
