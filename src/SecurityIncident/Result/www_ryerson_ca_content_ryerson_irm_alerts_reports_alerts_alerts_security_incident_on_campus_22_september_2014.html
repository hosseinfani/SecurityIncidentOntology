 <p><strong>Incident Details:</strong></p> 
 <p></p>
 <p>On Wednesday 17 September, 2014 Ryerson University Security &amp; Emergency Services came across the following incident, taking place outside the northwest entrance of the Image Arts building on Gould Street:</p> 
 <p>&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>At approximately 11:10 PM the victim, a male non-community member, and three of his friends were sitting at a table on the Gould Street sidewalk near the above location when the subject, a male non-community member, approached and asked them for a cigarette.&nbsp; Although everyone at the table declined to give him a cigarette, the subject persisted in continuing to ask for a cigarette, refusing to leave.&nbsp; An argument ensued between the subject and a witness who was sitting at the table, as the subject became increasingly aggressive and verbally abusive towards her because she would not give him a cigarette.&nbsp; The subject then struck victim’s head multiple times with a closed fist and threw a patio chair at the victim, as Ryerson University Security &amp; Emergency Services immediately intervened upon arrival, approaching and placing the suspect under arrest.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>The victim reported no injuries, declined medical assistance and did not wish to pursue any charges against the suspect.&nbsp; The suspect was subsequently turned over to Toronto Police Services. Ryerson University Security &amp; Emergency Services barred the suspect from campus. &nbsp;</p> 
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
