 <p>On Friday 22 November, 2013 Security &amp; Emergency Services were made aware of the following incident:</p> 
 <p>&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>At approximately 04:11 PM a female student was working in the Podium building on the 2nd floor when she was approached by the subject. The subject sat down next to the student and started making conversation related to pregnancy and epidurals. The subject then pulled out a hypodermic syringe, which was capped, and informed her he would give her an epidural. The student backed away and told the subject to leave her alone. The subject pocketed the syringe and touched her face while making sexual comments. The student told the subject to stop touching her, which he did. The student then packed up her belongings and left the area to contact Security &amp; Emergency Services.</p>
