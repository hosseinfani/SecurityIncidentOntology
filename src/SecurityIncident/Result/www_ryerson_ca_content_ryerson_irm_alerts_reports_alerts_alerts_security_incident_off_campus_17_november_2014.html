 <p></p>
 <p><b>On Thursday 13 November, 2014, at approximately 12:15 PM, Ryerson University Security &amp; Emergency Services were made aware of the following incident:</b></p> 
 <p><b>&nbsp;</b></p> 
 <p><b>A few minutes earlier, a non-Ryerson community member, was approached by the subject on the west sidewalk of Victoria Street, across from the Victoria (VIC) building.&nbsp; The subject became upset with the victim because he assumed the victim was soliciting for money at the entrance of the restaurant on the west side of Victoria Street, near Dundas Street.&nbsp; The victim told the subject that he was not soliciting and that he was employed by the restaurant. &nbsp;An argument ensued and the subject raised the cane that he was using to help him walk, and then swung it towards the victim, striking the victim on his back.&nbsp;</b></p> 
 <p><b>&nbsp;</b></p> 
 <p><b>The victim pointed the suspect out to Ryerson University Security &amp; Emergency Services, as the suspect was walking westbound on the south sidewalk of Dundas Street, at the intersection of Dundas Street and Victoria Street.&nbsp; The victim reported no physical injuries, declined medical care, and did not want Toronto Police Services involved at this time.&nbsp; Ryerson University Security &amp; Emergency Services conducted safety planning with the victim.&nbsp; The suspect was last seen walking westbound on Dundas Street towards Yonge Street.</b></p>
