 <p></p>
 <p><b>On Saturday November 08, 2014, at approximately 5:30 PM, Ryerson University Security &amp; Emergency Services were made aware of the following incident:</b></p> 
 <p><b>&nbsp;</b></p> 
 <p><b>Approximately fifteen minutes earlier, the victim, a Ryerson community member, observed a mobile phone being held near the space between the washroom stall and wall, on the other side of the adjacent stall in the men’s washroom, located on the 8<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;floor of the Library &amp; Archives (LIB) building. &nbsp;The victim then observed a phone being held over the stall that he was occupying by the subject who had been occupying the adjacent stall.&nbsp; The victim exited the stall and contacted Ryerson University Security &amp; Emergency Services.&nbsp;</b></p> 
 <p><b>&nbsp;</b></p> 
 <p><b>As the subject exited the adjacent stall, the victim advised the subject that he had seen him taking pictures and asked to see the subject’s phone.&nbsp; The subject denied taking any pictures, unlocked his phone, and appeared to be browsing and deleting pictures.&nbsp; The subject then showed the victim his phone, which appeared to be a different type of phone from that which he was last seen holding, and said that there were not any pictures on his phone.&nbsp; At this time, the victim and subject exited the washroom and the subject was last seen leaving in the direction of the stairs or elevators.</b></p> 
 <p><b>&nbsp;</b></p> 
 <p><b>Ryerson University Security &amp; Emergency Services conducted safety planning with the victim and a patrol of the area, but did not locate a person matching the subject’s description.&nbsp; The victim reported no physical injuries, declined medical attention, and did not want Toronto Police Services involved at this time.</b></p>
