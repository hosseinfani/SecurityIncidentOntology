 <p><strong>Incident Details:</strong></p> 
 <p></p>
 <p>On Wednesday 13 November, 2013 Security &amp; Emergency Services were made aware of the following incident:</p> 
 <p>&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>At approximately 08:15 PM a male student was walking north on Mutual Street by the 150 Mutual Street entrance, while the subject was walking southbound. The subject then approached the student and asked him if he had a phone. The student informed the subject he did not have a phone. The student was then pushed to the nearby wall, and the subject reached inside his pocket grabbing the studentâ€™s phone. The subject then left walking north on Mutual Street towards Gerrard Street. The student followed the subject asking for his phone back stating he would call the Police if the subject did not return it. The subject then advised the student to follow him.</p> 
 <p>&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>The student followed the subject northbound past Gerrard Street and stopped upon reaching the alleyway at the rear of the Pita Land restaurant. The student soon after attended the 160 Mutual Street lobby and notified Security &amp; Emergency Services of the robbery. The subject was last seen heading eastbound through the Pita Land alleyway.</p> 
 <p>&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>Security &amp; Emergency Services checked the area for the subject, but he was not located. The student was not physically injured in the incident and declined medical assistance. Toronto Police Services attended and took over the investigation.</p>
