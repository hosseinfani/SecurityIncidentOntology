 <p><strong>Incident Details:</strong></p> 
 <p></p>
 <p>On Sunday 17 November, 2013 Security &amp; Emergency Services were made aware of the following incident:</p> 
 <p>&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>At approximately 18:52 PM a female student was walking eastbound on Gould Street from the Victoria and Gould Street area. The subject approached her and attempted to engage her by asking for her name and phone number while following her. The student informed the subject she was not interested. The subject continued following the student still attempting to engage her. On reaching Church Street, the subject attempted to put his arm across the student’s back. The student backed away and left the area returning westbound on Gould Street.</p> 
 <p>&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>An hour later, while the student was shopping by Dalhousie and Gould Street, she saw the same subject with his arm across a woman walking eastbound. The student was concerned and notified Security &amp; Emergency Services.</p> 
 <p>&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>Security &amp; Emergency Services attended the area and located the subject who was heading West through the ILLC alleyway. Based on the subject’s behavior, the incident’s time and also the subject’s description, Security &amp; Emergency Services believe the subject may be the same person in the “Assault” Security Watch posted on 19 November, 2013.</p>
