 <p>On Thursday 11 April, 2013 Security and Emergency Services were made aware of the following incident:</p> 
 <p>&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>At approximately 06:30 pm a female student was walking by the Victoria and Gould Street intersection when she observed a man and a woman walking eastbound along Gould Street, on the North sidewalk. The man, who was walking ahead of the woman, abruptly stopped causing the woman to bump into him. The student heard the woman apologize to the male subject. The subject then turned around and began yelling and invading the woman’s personal space. The victim attempted to walk past the subject, who reached out with his right hand and grabbed the victim around her neck area and pushed her back. The victim managed to walk past the subject who followed her while yelling and screaming. The victim distanced herself and was last seen heading eastbound along Gould Street.</p>
