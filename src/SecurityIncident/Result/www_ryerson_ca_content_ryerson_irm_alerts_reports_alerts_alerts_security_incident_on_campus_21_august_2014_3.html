 <p>On Wednesday 20 August, 2014 Ryerson University Security &amp; Emergency Services were made aware of the following incident:</p> 
 <p>&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>At approximately 04:30 PM a community member was studying in the Library and Archives building on the 7th floor at a cubicle.

The victim immediately began packing up her belongings, and while doing this felt someone touching her feet. The victim left the area and notified Ryerson University Security &amp; Emergency Services of the incident.</p> 
 <p>&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>The victim did not want Toronto Police Services involved. Ryerson University Security &amp; Emergency Services searched the area for the subject, but he was not located.</p>
