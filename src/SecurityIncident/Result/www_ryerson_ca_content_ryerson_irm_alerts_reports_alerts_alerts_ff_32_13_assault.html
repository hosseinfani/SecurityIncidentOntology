 <p>On Monday 18 November, 2013 Security &amp; Emergency Services were made aware of the following incident:</p> 
 <p>&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>On 17 November, 2013 at approximately 07:30 PM a female student was walking eastbound on Gould Street on the south sidewalk. The student stopped at Church Street and sat down on nearby planters, while waiting for the traffic lights. The subject approached the student and sat next to her. The subject asked her what her name was, and if she liked “Gucci or Louis Vuitton” adding he could sell her some. The student declined, and continued eastbound as the lights had turned green.</p> 
 <p>&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>The subject followed her closely behind still asking her for her name. On crossing Church Street, the subject placed his arm around her back and asked her where she lived, who she was meeting and continued asking for her name. With his arm still around her, the subject attempted to redirect the student, asking her if she wanted to come with him. The student yelled “No”, at which time the subject released her. The subject was last seen heading north on Mutual Street.</p> 
 <p>&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>The student was not physically injured in the incident. The student informed Security &amp; Emergency Services she would file a report with Toronto Police Services.</p>
