 <p><strong>Incident Details:</strong></p> 
 <p></p>
 <p>On Friday 24 May, 2013 Ryerson University Security and Emergency Services were advised that the following had occurred:</p> 
 <p>&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>A library user advised that the subject had entered the Ryerson Learning Resource Centre 7<sup>th</sup> floor at approximately 4:30 pm and was walking around at that location.&nbsp; At approximately 4:55 pm he noticed that the subject sat across from a female student, pushed his chair back, and started crawling under the desk.&nbsp; The subject then noticed he was being watched, got up, and left the area.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>The library user then left the area and called Security and Emergency Services.&nbsp; He advised that he has seen the man on several occasions over the past three weeks on the 7<sup>th</sup> floor, and that he was seen engaging in similar behaviour on at least two previous occasions.&nbsp; During the prior occasions, while under the desk, he appeared to be touching the women’s feet through their shoes.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>The subject may be focusing this behavior towards young Asian women and may be carrying additional clothing with him to allow him to alter his appearance throughout the day.</p> 
 <p>&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>Security and Emergency Services attended the area and located the suspect depicted in the photos on the 7<sup>th</sup> floor.&nbsp; This suspect was subsequently barred from the Ryerson University campus.</p>
