 <p>On Tuesday 11 February, 2014 Security &amp; Emergency Services were made aware of the following incident:</p> 
 <p>&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>At approximately 21:23 PM a female student was washing her hands inside a women’s washroom in the Kerr Hall building. The subject entered the washroom and asked for her phone. The student refused to give the subject her phone. The subject apologized for being in the washroom and stated he needed some money. The subject then backed the student into a corner and took her bag and began rummaging through it, taking some cash. The subject pushed the student backwards when she showed resistance and then left the washroom.</p> 
 <p>&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>The victim was not injured. Security &amp; Emergency Services patrolled the area, but did not locate the subject. Toronto Police Services attended and took over the investigation.</p>
