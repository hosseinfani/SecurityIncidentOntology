 <p>On Monday 17 March, 2014 at approximately 11:30 PM, community members reported an altercation in Victoria Laneway to Security &amp; Emergency Services.</p> 
 <p>&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>Security &amp; Emergency Services attended the 350 Victoria Street area and observed the subject, who was topless, yelling at two males and a female walking southbound towards Gould Street. One of the male parties approached security and reported that the subject was yelling and screaming at passersby’s and had also punched him in the face. The victim did not want Police involvement and did not require medical assistance. The victim together with the female party left the area, informing Security &amp; Emergency Services they were not community members.</p> 
 <p>&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>The subject, still yelling at people, was approached by Security &amp; Emergency Services and offered assistance locating his clothes. Open wounds which appeared to have been caused by an edged weapon were evident on the subject. The subject declined medical assistance and claimed not to remember when he had been injured or by whom. Toronto Police and Emergency Medical Services attended the area and commenced their investigation. The subject was taken to hospital by the paramedics. &nbsp;It is not known where the subject received these injuries, or what they were caused by.</p>
