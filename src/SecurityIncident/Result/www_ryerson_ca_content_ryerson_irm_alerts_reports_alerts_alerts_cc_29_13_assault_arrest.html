 <p><strong>Incident Details:</strong></p> 
 <p></p>
 <p>On Monday 11 November, 2013 at approximately 10:00 PM Security &amp; Emergency Services were approached at Victoria and Gould Street by a female student. The student reported being assaulted and pointed to the subject who was walking eastbound on Gould Street.</p> 
 <p>&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>The victim reported walking south on Victoria Street by the 297 Victoria Street entrance, when she noticed the subject who was walking northbound while yelling incoherently. The victim and subject made eye contact momentarily, and soon after the subject walked towards the victim and swung his right hand towards her head. The victim managed to push the subject away from her, although she was struck at the top of her head. The subject then proceeded north on Victoria Street turning on Gould Street heading eastbound.</p> 
 <p>&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>Security &amp; Emergency Services approached the subject by the 60 Gould Street planters, and arrested him after determining he was barred from Ryerson University. The subject was subsequently turned over to Toronto Police Services who took over the investigation.</p> 
 <p>&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>The student was not physically injured in the incident and declined medical assistance.</p>
