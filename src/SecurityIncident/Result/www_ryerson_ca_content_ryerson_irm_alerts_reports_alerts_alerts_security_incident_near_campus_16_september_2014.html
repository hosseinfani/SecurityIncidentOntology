 <p><strong>Incident Details:</strong></p> 
 <p></p>
 <p>On Friday 12 September, 2014 Ryerson University Security &amp; Emergency Services were made aware of the following incident taking place near the International Living Learning Centre, just north of the intersection of Gould Street and Mutual Street.</p> 
 <p>&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>At approximately 02:30 PM a male community member was walking from the Rogers Communication Centre to the International Living Learning Centre, when a vehicle travelling northbound, described as a dark green Jeep bearing a Quebec licence plate, stopped on Mutual Street and Gould Street, and the driver asked the victim for directions.&nbsp; After the victim provided the subject with directions, the subject engaged the victim in conversation, claiming that he was a fashion designer, recently had a show in Toronto, and then offered the victim some free clothing.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>The victim agreed and the subject parked and exited his vehicle on the east side of Mutual Street.&nbsp; The subject opened the rear door on the driver’s side, showed the victim two black bags in the back of his car and&nbsp;told the victim to get into the vehicle to look at the clothes.&nbsp; Although the victim had told the subject that he did not want to get into the vehicle, the subject remained persistent about the victim getting into the car.&nbsp; At this time the victim told the subject that he did not need any free clothes and then left, going into the International Living Learning Centre before contacting Ryerson University Security &amp; Emergency Services.&nbsp; Toronto Police Services have been informed.</p>
