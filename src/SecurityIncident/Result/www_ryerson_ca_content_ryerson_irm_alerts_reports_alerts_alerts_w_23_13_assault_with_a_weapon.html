 <p><strong>Incident Details:</strong></p> 
 <p></p>
 <p>On Tuesday 10 September, 2013 Security and Emergency Services were made aware of the following incident:</p> 
 <p>&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>At approximately 02:23 AM a non-community member was walking westbound on Gerrard Street just past O’Keefe Laneway. Three male subjects approached the victim and called him a “juice head”. The victim ignored them and continued walking. Subject 1, who was holding a glass cup containing what was believed to be a soft drink, threw the contents at the victim’s face. The victim confronted the subject who then dropped the cup and produced a knife. The victim again confronted the subject, who together with the other 2 subjects left the area in a blue Ford Fusion, westbound on Gerrard Street.</p>

 <p>Toronto Police Services attended the area and took over the investigation. No injuries were reported by the victim. &nbsp;</p>
