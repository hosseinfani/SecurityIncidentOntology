 <p><strong>Incident Details:</strong></p> 
 <p></p>
 <p>On Sunday 08 September, 2013 Security and Emergency Services were made aware of the following incident:</p> 
 <p>&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>At approximately 08:25 PM on 08 September, 2013 three community guests were sitting on the planters just south of the 350 Victoria Street bike pods. The guests were approached by a group of 5 males who asked them if they wanted to buy marijuana. All the guests said no and Subject 1 stated “You guys are gonna get hurt”. Subject 2 then sat down next to one of the guests, who had been moving her belongings from her pockets to her purse, by first placing them on the planter next to her. The subjects all soon left the area southbound on Victoria Street, while Security and Emergency Services staff were approaching Victoria and Gould Street. Shortly after, the victim who had been moving her belongings noticed her debit card and change missing and advised security staff, while pointing at the subjects who were running south through the Devonian Pond.</p> 
 <p>&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>Security and Emergency Services staff monitored the subjects, while coordinating a response with Toronto Police Services. Subject 2 was arrested shortly thereafter by Toronto Police Services at an off campus location. The subject was barred from Ryerson University. Vague descriptions were provided for the other subjects.</p>
