 <p><strong>Incident Details:</strong></p> 
 <p></p>
 <p>On Tuesday 28 October, 2014, at approximately 3:00 AM Ryerson University Security &amp; Emergency Services were made aware of the following incident:</p> 
 <p>&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>Approximately one hour earlier, the victim, a Ryerson community member, was approached by three subjects on the north side of the George Vari Engineering and Computing Centre (ENG) on the south sidewalk of Gould Street.&nbsp; The subjects asked the victim if he “wanted to hang out with them” and the victim declined.&nbsp; One subject persisted in trying to convince the victim to join them as he placed his hands on the victim’s shoulder from behind.&nbsp; The victim pushed the subject away and left the area, walking eastbound towards the International Living and Learning Centre (ILC).&nbsp; At this time, the victim realized he was missing his wallet, which he had placed in his right coat pocket.&nbsp; The victim then contacted Toronto Police Services and Ryerson University Security &amp; Emergency Services to report the incident.</p> 
 <p>&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>The victim was unable to provide a detailed description of the subjects, who were last observed walking north-bound&nbsp;on Church Street&nbsp;and then west-bound on the north sidewalk of Gerrard Street.&nbsp; The victim reported no physical injuries, declined medical assistance, and Ryerson University Security &amp; Emergency Services conducted safety planning with the victim.</p>
