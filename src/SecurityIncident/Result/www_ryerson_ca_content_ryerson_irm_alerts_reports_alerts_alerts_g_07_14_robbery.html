 <p><strong>Incident Details:</strong></p> 
 <p></p>
 <p>On Saturday 15 February, 2014 Security &amp; Emergency Services were made aware of the following incident:</p> 
 <p>&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>Two female students were in the Ram in the Rye pub where they met several males who offered to buy them drinks and asked them to come outside. At approximately 12:30 AM one of the female students was walking along Gould Street with 3 of the males. During the walk, subject 2 kept steering the student in the direction he wanted and the other males kept touching her and only stopped once she told them to. At around Victoria Street and Gould Street, one of the subjects’ asked for the student’s phone number and pulled out his phone to record it. Subject 1 then grabbed her purse, which was hanging on her shoulder, and fled south on Victoria Street and was last seen heading west on Dundas Street. The other subjects claimed not to know subject 1 and soon left the area. The purse was recovered shortly thereafter in the Devonian Pond area but was missing several of its contents.</p> 
 <p>&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>The victim was not injured. Toronto Police Services attended and took over the investigation.</p>
