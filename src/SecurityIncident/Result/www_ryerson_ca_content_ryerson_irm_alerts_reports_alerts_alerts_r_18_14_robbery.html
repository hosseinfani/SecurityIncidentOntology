 <p><strong>Incident Details:</strong></p> 
 <p></p>
 <p>On Tuesday 08 July, 2014 at approximately 10:38 PM Ryerson University Security &amp; Emergency Services came across the following incident taking place at 297 Victoria Street near Devo pond:</p> 
 <p>A man was found semi-conscious and bleeding from his mouth and the right side of his head. &nbsp;Several other males appeared to be fleeing the area. Ryerson University Security &amp; Emergency Services provided medical assistance and called an ambulance and Toronto Police Services. The males were monitored by Security staff until they left the campus area.</p> 
 <p>Toronto Police Services attended the area and commenced their investigation. The victim was taken to hospital with serious but non-life threatening injuries.</p> 
 <p>The initial investigation appears to indicate that the victim was repeatedly punched by Subject 1 while the other males surrounded them.&nbsp; The victim then fell to the ground and the other males took items from the victim’s pockets. Subject 1 left the area heading eastbound through the alley way beside the Image Arts building. The other males fled the area west on Gould Street, north on Yonge Street, and got into a vehicle parked at 21 Gerrard Street.</p> 
 <p>Ryerson Security &amp; Emergency Services are continuing to assist Toronto Police Services with their investigation.</p>
