 <p></p>
 <p>On Saturday 08 February, 2014 Security &amp; Emergency Services were made aware of the following incident:</p> 
 <p>&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>At approximately 02:05 PM community members were approached by the subject in Kerr Hall on the lower ground by the northwest stairwell. The subject attempted to sell a Raptor’s sports shirt to the group who declined buying it. The subject continued talking with the group and after calling one of them stupid was asked to leave or security would be called. The subject then tapped his waist band and stated he would “pop” security should they show up and kept repeating he was “strapped”. The subject then pointed his hands out towards the group and made motions as though he was shooting guns at them. The suspect then ran away from the group heading east through the north hallway and was last seen heading up the 45 Gerrard Street stairwell.</p> 
 <p>&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>The victims were not injured. Security &amp; Emergency Services patrolled the area, but did not locate the subject. Toronto Police Services attended and took over the investigation.</p>
